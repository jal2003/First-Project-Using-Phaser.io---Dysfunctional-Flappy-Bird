Hello! 

This was my test for the new phaser platform. 

I attempted to create a flappy bird game with HTML and Javascript along with the phaser.io code

There is also an attached recording on how the game is played. I have not added any buttons or text or a scoreboard. It is a very simple game where the bird 
is a spritesheet and it has to avoid touching the green pipes. If it touches the green pipe, then game over, REFRESH the screen. 


HOW TO PLAY 

Hold the UP Arrow Key to play. If you let go of the Up Arrow Key, the bird will start to fall. So HOLD WISELY. 

ENJOY! 






ps. there is quite to improve in this game but it was fun trial and errroring with the application!
